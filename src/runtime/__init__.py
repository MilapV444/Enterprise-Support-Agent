"""The turn loop: what happens to an accepted turn (M7-01; FR-1, FR-6, FR-9, FR-13, FR-30, FR-32, FR-40).

channels.api accepts a turn (202) and hands it to dispatch(); Dispatcher runs it on a small worker pool, one
turn at a time per conversation, and TurnLoop.run() takes it from there:

1. a status event ("Looking into it");
2. input screening (safety.screening): a blocked message is answered at once and nothing else sees it;
3. PII tokens (safety.pii): from here on only tokenized text reaches Jev, the models or the checkpoint;
4. the statechart (core.orchestrator) on the case's thread, with Jev triage, or the LLM classifier when Jev is
   not configured (its confidence is capped below what an SOP needs);
5. the answer: retrieval once per turn (knowledge.retrieval, the public collection for an anonymous customer,
   plus the tenant's own once signed in: customer_visible passages and the internal runbooks, which are read
   but never cited), then the specialists (agents.topology): Jev picks a lead and any co-specialists, each
   reads the passages for its domain and returns typed claims, and agents.merge checks them and has the
   coordinator draft the one reply through the model router (cost.router, free tiers first) behind the
   output checks (safety.output). Without Jev the generalist answers alone. No claim means the documentation
   does not cover it, and the case goes to a person. A clarifying question when the case waits for the
   customer; a hand-off notice when it goes to a person;
6. citation events for the customer_visible passages the accepted claims cite, then one final event with the
   AI disclosure, and a decision record with its why view (safety.governance) and the steps the turn took,
   which channels.api.trace shows the customer as a tier-filtered "how this was answered" view.

Any failure publishes an error event: a customer never waits on silence. The case is the conversation for
now (case linking is not wired); procedures (SOPs) have no tools yet, so a procedure turn answers from the
knowledge base and changes nothing. Turns run in the API process, not yet on Temporal: a crash loses the turn
in flight (its checkpoint survives). See the open-issues register.
