"""Merging specialist findings into one reply in one voice (FR-29 / MA-ADP-05: MA-D7, MA-D16, MA-D12, MA-D13,
MA-D15, MA-D17).

merge(engine, results, evidence, draft) -> Outcome, exactly one per turn:

1. claims: each specialist result's typed claims (claims_from: until agents.topology carries the contracts,
   a completed result's findings are a JSON list of claims). A claim is a topic, an optional number with its
   unit, its text and the evidence ids it cites; the role is the result's, never the claim's own say.
2. numbers, in code only: two claims on the same topic with numbers that differ (beyond the unit's
   tolerance), or in different units, go to a person with the values side by side. Jev never judges numbers.
3. other disagreements: Jev scores, on masked text, how strongly each claim's own cited evidence supports it
   (five levels). One claim at four or five while every other is at one or two wins; anything closer goes
   to a person. Jev unavailable -> a person.
4. the reply: draft(accepted claims) is called once, by the coordinator (the only author of customer text).
   It is held for a person when Jev thinks it sends the customer to another team (P >= 0.20, or Jev cannot
   answer), or when it claims a completed action no verified write backs.
