"""The coordinator and its specialists (FR-25 / MA-ADP-01: MA-D1, MA-D2, MA-D10, MA-D11; FR-26 / MA-ADP-02:
MA-D3, MA-D6, MA-D8).

- registry(): the static specialist set (generalist, billing, technical, account_ops), fixed at start-up and
  read-only afterwards. Each has a description Jev reads (no digits, the Jev rule) and a tool allow-list of
  registered, read-only tools (writes come with the approval rules of MA-ADP-04); the coordinator has no
  tools.
- delegate(): one Jev request over the masked message. A choice picks the lead (below 0.50 confidence
  nothing is dispatched and the case goes to a person); a yes / no per other domain specialist adds it at
  P >= 0.80; a yes / no per added specialist says whether it needs the lead's findings first. Jev
  unavailable or invalid (DecisionEngine checks every answer's shape, option and confidence) -> a person.
  Step budgets are handed out before anything runs, so parallel branches cannot overrun them: the
  coordinator's delegation is one step, the lead gets up to two, then the others in order while the turn's
  six last; a specialist with no budget left is not dispatched, so a turn has at most three specialists.
- coordinator(): a LangGraph graph, started with start_turn() on the case's own thread. The plan is checked
  again wherever it is read (roles, budgets, the turn total), so a malformed or inflated plan in state is
  refused, not run. Independent specialists run in parallel (Send); dependent ones run after the lead, only
  when the lead completed, with its findings in their brief; otherwise they are recorded as skipped. Each
  specialist is its own compiled subgraph run inside the coordinator's node, so its state is checkpointed
  with the case's. Depth is one: a specialist can only call tools on its allow-list, never another agent, and
  returns validated findings to the coordinator, never text to the customer. Results are kept in role order.
- Tools run through run_tool(ToolRequest): the turn's tenant, case, session and principal come from the
  turn; executor_tool() runs it through tools.execution.Executor, which verifies the principal against the
  live session, mints the credential, validates the arguments and screens the output. The call id is
  deterministic per turn, specialist and step, so a retried node reuses the same idempotency key. A
  specialist sees a tool's screened text or the failure's code, never an exception message.
