## 1. Executive Summary & Architectural Mission

The **Agent Orchestration Core** serves as the central cognitive control plane of the enterprise support agent. It is responsible for:
1. Translating unstructured customer dialogue into structured, verifiable execution trajectories.
2. Enforcing regulatory, security, and operational invariants on all system state mutations.
3. Balancing fast deterministic execution for routine standard operating procedures (SOPs) against deep deliberative reasoning for novel, complex diagnostic cases.
4. Providing self-healing, crash-resilient execution with guaranteed recovery and human escalation.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations (Literature Review Mapping)

### 2.1 Dual-Process Cognitive Theory (System 1 vs. System 2)
* **Foundational Literature:** Stanovich & West (2000); Kahneman (2011).
* **Engineering Formulation:**
  * **System 1 (Deterministic FSM Statechart):** Rapid, predictable, zero-temperature execution of known Enterprise SOPs (e.g. invoice retrieval, password reset, order tracking). $S_{t+1} = \text{Reducer}(S_t, \Delta_t)$.
  * **System 2 (Deliberative ReAct & Replanner):** Slow, reflective, multi-step problem decomposition for unstructured outages and cross-system diagnostics. $\tau_t = (o_0, r_0, a_0, \dots)$.

### 2.2 Clinical Triage & Acuity Protocols (ESI / MTS)
* **Foundational Literature:** Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Handbook (Gilboy et al., 2011); Manchester Triage System (Mackway-Jones, 1997).
* **Engineering Formulation:**
  * Queries undergo an upfront acuity and resource estimation pass before any cognitive reasoning or tool invocation occurs.
  * **Level 1/2 (High Acuity / Standard SOP):** Direct routing to System 1 FSM.
  * **Level 3 (Ambiguous Intent):** Execution is frozen, emitting a targeted clarification prompt to prevent hallucinated assumptions.
  * **Level 4/5 (Unstructured Diagnostic):** Routed to System 2 deliberative replanning.

### 2.3 Baddeley Multicomponent Working Memory Model
* **Foundational Literature:** Baddeley (2000); Liu et al. (2023) *"Lost in the Middle"*.
* **Engineering Formulation:**
  * Context windows are partitioned into strict token budget allocations:
    * **15%**: Immutable System Persona, Role Boundaries & Safety Invariants.
    * **15%**: Customer Identity & Chronic Account Fact Graph (Mem0 / Zep).
    * **35%**: Slotted RAG Document Passages (ColBERT MaxSim + BM25).
    * **25%**: Chronological Dialogue Buffer (sliding window turns).
    * **10%**: Ephemeral Scratchpad Buffer for intermediate plan thoughts.
  * **LongLLMLingua** perplexity filtering drops 40–60% of low-information tokens.

### 2.4 High-Reliability Organizing (HRO) & Error Recovery
* **Foundational Literature:** Weick & Sutcliffe (2007) *Managing the Unexpected*; Shinn et al. (2023) *Reflexion*.
* **Engineering Formulation:**
  * **Reflexion Self-Critique:** $c_t = \text{LLM\_reflect}(\tau_t, S_t, \Omega)$ allows up to 2 verbal self-correction trials for transient tool/API errors.
  * **Hard Step Ceiling Guard:** Anti-loop tripwire halts execution if step count $N > 4$.
  * **Metacognitive Uncertainty Gating:** Semantic entropy calculation determines whether confidence $\ge 0.90$. If $< 0.90$ or if the circuit breaker trips, execution immediately escalates to a Human Specialist (HITL).

## 3. Detailed Component Architecture

### Stage 1: Ingress & Context Engineering
* **Inputs:** Raw user query string, tenant identifier, channel metadata (Slack/Teams/Web), OAuth2/JWT claims.
* **Processing:**
  1. Validates user authentication and RBAC permissions.
  2. Queries vector/relational stores to retrieve tenant profile and chronic issue facts.
  3. Formulates hybrid search query for RAG passages.
  4. Compiles Baddeley slot envelope and compresses low-information tokens via LongLLMLingua.
* **Output:** Normalized, typed Pydantic `ContextEnvelope` payload.

### Stage 2: Acuity & Intent Triage Gate
* **Inputs:** `ContextEnvelope` payload.
* **Processing:**
  1. Fast SLM (e.g. Instructor/Pydantic) executes multi-label classification and entity slot extraction.
  2. Calculates customer frustration / urgency acuity score.
  3. Evaluates ESI decision logic:
     * High Acuity / Standard SOP $\to$ Dispatch to System 1 FSM.
     * Complex Outage / Diagnostic $\to$ Dispatch to System 2 ReAct.
     * Missing parameter slots $\to$ Dispatch Clarification Return.
* **Guarantees:** Triage latency $< 150\text{ms}$; deterministic boundary enforcement.

### Stage 3: Dual-Process Cognitive Engine
* **System 1 (LangGraph FSM):**
  * Loads thread checkpoint from PostgreSQL.
  * Verifies parameter invariants with strict regex/schema guards.
  * Dispatches verified deterministic tools (<300ms, zero temperature).
  * On schema validation exception or unknown runbook branch: gracefully escalates to System 2.
* **System 2 (Deliberative ReAct & Replanner):**
  * Decomposes goal into a Plan-and-Solve Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): $P'_{k+1:K} = \text{Replanner}(P_{k:K}, o_k)$.
  * Interleaves reasoning steps ($r_t$) and action payloads ($a_t$).
  * Dispatches diagnostic inspection tools and aggregates log/telemetry findings.
* **Circuit Breaker & Reflexion:**
  * If a tool invocation fails, generates verbal critique $c_t$ and prepends to context.
  * Maximum 2 Reflexion retry trials.
  * Hard StepCeilingGuard trips if total iterations exceed 4.
  * Emits `IncidentDiagnosticPacket` and trips immediately to Human Specialist (HITL).
* **Ambiguity Return:**
  * Generates clarifying question back to customer UI; suspends workflow thread awaiting user response.

### Stage 4: Execution Sandbox & Verification Gate
* **Sandboxed Tool Execution:**
  * Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool caller with rate-limiting and circuit breakers.
  * Two-Phase mutation checks (dry-run staging before writing side-effects).
  * Distributed Saga coordinator with compensating transactions for multi-system actions.
* **Confidence & Policy Gate:**
  * Computes semantic entropy and checks citation density against retrieved RAG chunks.
  * Enforces statutory compliance (GDPR/HIPAA/PCI-DSS) and financial risk limits (> $1,000 mandates human review).
  * **Score $\ge 0.90$:** Verified & Approved $\to$ Advance to Stage 5.
  * **Score $< 0.90$ OR Breaker Tripped:** Immediate escalation to Human Specialist.

### Stage 5: Durable Checkpointing & Delivery
* **Temporal.io & PostgreSQL Checkpointer:**
  * Atomic state snapshot committed to PostgreSQL.
  * Event-sourced replayability guarantees zero state loss across pod restarts.
  * Coordinates multi-day SLA timers and human approval signals.
* **Async Fact Extraction:**
  * Background worker scans completed turn, extracts verified customer facts, and updates Mem0 / Zep knowledge graph.
* **Response Delivery:**
  * Low-latency SSE/WebSocket token streaming to customer UI with citations and action buttons.
  * Emits distributed OpenTelemetry traces (W3C traceparent) and token usage logs.
